                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>We don't want you to pay for what you don't need. It's exactly why we offer different pricing plans for different businesses—whether you're a large company, small team or moonlighting freelancer.

                        Before choosing a subscription, you cantrial Timely free for 14 days. During your trial, you have unlimited access to all of Timely’s features, so you can work out which features give you the most value.

              <div class="faq-body">
                  <p>Once your trial period ends, everything you've tracked in Timely will be saved, so there's no need to rush into a decision. If you do choose to subscribe, everything—all your logged hours, projects, users, reports and memories—will be there as you left it.

                    If you don't know how much time you have left in your trial, head to Settings > Subscriptions and check your trial counter in the top-right corner. Once your trial expires, you will need to purchase a subscription to continue using Timely. </p>

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Timely is not an employee monitoring software.

                <p>Your data is securely transferred and stored on ISO 27001-certified Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers in Europe.

Our database is also completely encrypted. Only our Chief Data Protection Officer, Deputy Data Protection Officer (DPO) and Head of Growth can access the databases used to store information from Memory products. All data is protected by an internal auditing system (SQL audit logging) and DPO approval is required for database access (which is only granted as read-only).</p>
